I made this presentation slides and notebook during an introductory sharing on NUS's Residential College 4 sharing during OrcaCode.

Slides loosely follow the series made by Prof Alfred Menezes, and diagrams belong to him.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsKfGn1YKlg)

Thanks to Chien Hao, Yen Zhe for making this happen.
